You have two options to make tests for this project ,
the first one I made a hard coded Test file under app/core/tests , you can run everything from there .
the second one is using Junit , in order to use this type of tests you need to navigate -
- src/test/java/app/core/ and under core you will have two packages , one for the repositories -
- and the second is for the services , all you need to do is run the test you want to check .

Thanks for your time and have a good day !
